 
  oldrunner TODO list
  -------------------

Here are listed the modifications I should perform on loderunner in future
releases. Feel free to send me an email/patch (frederic@culot.org) if you
would like to see a feature added.


  *  Add a command-line flag to set game difficulty (acting on FOES_DELAY, BRICK_LATENCY...)
  *  Add support for high-scores recording
  *  Allow user to pause the game
  *  Make it possible to load user-created levels
