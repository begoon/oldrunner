.SH NAME
Oldrunner \- Broderbund's Loderunner remake
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "oldrunner "
[\fB-v\fP] [\fB-l\fP<\fInum\fP>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Oldrunner is a remake of Broderbund's Loderunner which contains the
150 original game levels. In order to win a level, the player '\fB@\fP'
must collect all gold bags '\fB$\fP' without being touched by ennemies
(same sprite '\fB@\fP' as player but in reverse video). Once all gold
is collected an escape ladder usually appears and the player must
travel to the top of the screen to reach the next level. The player can
dig holes into floors to temporarily trap ennemies and may then safely
walk atop them. Over time, floors dug into will regenerate, filling in
these holes. A trapped ennemy who cannot escape a hole before it fills
is consumed, immediately respawning in a random location at the top of
the level.
